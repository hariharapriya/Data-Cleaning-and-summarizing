# Data Cleaning and summarising

In this project, we will examine a data file and carry out the first steps of the data
science process, including the cleaning and exploration of data.

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.
The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to
the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would
be (‘yes’) or not (‘no’) subscribed.

Task1.ipynb consists the code for data preparation where the data is loaded and preprocessed.

Task2.ipynb consists the code for data exploration where various visualizations are used to 
inspect all the attributes in the dataset.
